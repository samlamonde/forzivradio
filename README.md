  ForzIVRadio takes any .mp3, .wav, .ogg, .flac, .m4a, or .aac files and combines them with DJ commentary for a 100% game-realistic custom radio station!
To use ForzIVRadio, drag and drop your desired music tracks into the "music" folder and run. Your immersive playlist will pop out as a single .wav in the "output" folder.
DJ volume, music volume, fade length, etc. can be configured at the top of the script. For the best experience, I recommend muting the in-game radio in Forza's audio settings and tuning to Timeless FM to have those extra long skill songs racking up points in the background.

Current release is far from complete, I just wanted to put something out here to start tracking progress. Sorry if your favorite DJ isn't on here yet, they will be soon! (there are literally hundreds of voice lines for me to sort by DJ / season)

# To do (in order):
- Sort *Horizon Pulse* lines into seasons and release
- Sort *Hospital Records* Radio lines into seasons and release
- Sort *Bass Arena* lines into seasons and release
- Sort *Timeless FM* lines into seasons and release
- Sort *Horizon XS* lines into seasons and release
