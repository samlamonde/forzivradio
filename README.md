Immersive customizable listening experience with Forza Horizon 4's radio DJs

To use ForzIVRadio, drag and drop your desired music tracks into the "music" folder and run. Your immersive playlist will pop out as a single .wav in the "output" folder.
DJ volume, music volume, fade length, etc. can be configured at the top of the script.
Current release is far from complete, I just wanted to put something out here to start tracking progress.
