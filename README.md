# forzivradio
ForzIVRadio takes any .mp3, .wav, or .ogg files and combines them with DJ commentary for a 100% game-realistic custom radio station!

To use ForzIVRadio, drag and drop your desired music tracks into the "music" folder and run. Your immersive playlist will pop out as a single .wav in the "output" folder.
DJ volume, music volume, fade length, etc. can be configured at the top of the script. For the best experience, I recommend using no more than 30 44.1Hz-96Hz audio files at a time.
Current release is far from complete, I just wanted to put something out here to start tracking progress.
